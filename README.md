# Project Name: Modern E-commerce Application Deployment on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)

*Introduction*
Welcome to the project for deploying modern e-commerce applications! This project will use cutting-edge technology, security procedures, and DevOps concepts to transform online purchasing. We will use Docker containerization and a number of microservices to create a full e-commerce application on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).

Project Summary
Using Saleor, an open-source e-commerce platform, we will build, configure, deploy, and secure a contemporary e-commerce application suite in this project. A PostgreSQL database with an in-memory Redis cache, a React frontend, a Python API backend, and supporting services are some of the components that make up the program.
